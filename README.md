Created a weather app using Django with the help of a Weather API
In this project, I fetch data in the form of json response from Airnow API which is a free API. This API helps us to fetch the air quality 
for different cities in the US. It's free to use.
Then using Bootstrap I designed a basic web layout for the weather app and displayed the data from the json object. Simply,
we need to enter the Zip Code in the search form to view the AQI and based on the range of AQI it describes the severity of the polluted air.
